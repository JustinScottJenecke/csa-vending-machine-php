# csa-vending-machine-php

## Simple vending machine app to broken down into sections to serve as code walkthroughs and lectures.

## Stack and Tools:
  - PHP
  - HTML & CSS
  - Bulma CSS
  - OOP
  - JSON for data persistence
  

# Lesson plan and outline:

This project walkthrough should be undertaken once the students have completed the module on superglobals since this project starts off with Assoc Arrays as products stored inside of SESSION variables. It will progressively move towards Functions, OOP, then round it off File Handling and data persistence.

<ol>
  <li>Intro to PHP - Syntax, variables, types, conditionals</li>
  <li>Enumerating PHP - Arrays, Multidemensional Arrays, Associative Arrays, Loops</li>
</ol>

### 2. PHP Learn by example - Code Walkthrough
<ol>
  <li>SuperGlobals - GET & POST & SESSIONS, Assoc Arrays and CRUD to a SESSION variable</li>
  <li>Functions - Abstract CRUD functionality functions, introduce concept of includes, require</li>
  <li>OOP Fundamentals - Classes, Fields and Methods vs Variables and Functions, Access Modifiers, GET & SET</li>
